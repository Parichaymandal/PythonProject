# PythonProject
This branch was created by Giulia; it contains 3 functions and 1 folder with 24 single band .tifs

**SingleTifs_to_StackedTif.py** -> contains the function *SingleTifToStacked()* that takes in the single band .tifs and stack them. The first output is a .vrt file, the second one is a multiband .tif

**Import_Raster.py** -> contains 2 functions: *loadrast()* and *getrastinfo()*. The fist one loads the multiband raster; the second one gets general information from it.
